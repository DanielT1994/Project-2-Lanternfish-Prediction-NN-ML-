# Project2

plan is to see if we can use machine learning and NN to predict values that are exponential in nature.
We have an input from a coding problem that can be solved algorithmically, and we would use ML and NN to see if they could predict the values and how accurate each model is.
We would then plot to see which one did the best.
Plan is to use input from the first 50 days from the algorithm, then see if the ML could use the previous days to predict an accurate number for the next day.
